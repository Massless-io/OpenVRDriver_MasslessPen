# Massless Pen API

The Massless Pen API (or at least the headers) is required to build this project.
It is available from the Massless website on the developers page.
https://massless.io/developers/

Once you have unzipped the API, copying the contents of the API folder into this API folder should allow you to build the project.
However, it will not run unless you have the Massless Pen and Tracker hardware plugged into your computer.
The driver as a standalone peice of software is an example of how an OpenVR driver can be written.
